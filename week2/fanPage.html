    <div class='Birth'>
        <h3>Birth 1960</h3><br> Jean-Michel Basquiat was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1960. His mother was of Puerto Rican
        heritage, and his father a Haitian immigrant, the combination of which eventually led to the young Jean-Michel's
        fluency in French, Spanish, and English (indeed, early readings of French symbolist poetry would come to influence
        Basquiat's later work). Basquiat displayed a talent for art in early childhood, learning to draw and paint with his
        mother's encouragement.

        <h3>childhood 1966 </h3><br> Basquiat displayed a talent for art in early childhood, learning to draw and paint with
        his mother's encouragement. Together they attended New York City museum exhibitions, and by the age of six, Jean-Michel
        found himself already enrolled as a Junior Member of the Brooklyn Museum. After being hit by a car as a young child,
        Basquiat underwent surgery for the removal of his spleen, an event that led to his reading the famous medical and
        artistic treatise, Gray's Anatomy.

    <div class='SAMO'>
        <h3>1972 </h3><br> In 1972, he and an artist friend, Al Diaz, started spray-painting buildings in Lower Manhattan under
        the nom de plume, SAMO, an acronym for "Same Old Shit". With its anti-establishment, anti-religion, anti-politics
        credo packaged in an ultra-contemporary format, SAMO soon received media attention from the counter-culture press,
        the Village Voice the most notable among them. After taking note of the mantra, contemporary street artist, Keith
        Haring, staged a mock wake for SAMO at his Club 57.

    <div class='Legacy'>
        <h3>Legacy </h3><br> Basquiat and his counter-cultural example persist. His art remains a constant source of inspiration
        for contemporary artists, his short, but seemingly epic life a constant source of intrigue for a global art-loving
        public.
